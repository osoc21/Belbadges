[At Open Code of Summer](https://osoc.be/) two students created a communications strategy for the proof of a concept of Edubadges Belgium. Edubadges Belgium is an effort to bring the [Edubadges platform](https://www.surf.nl/en/edubadges-issuing-digital-certificates-to-students) (developed by Surf in The Netherlands) to Belgium as a microcredentialing solution for (higher) education & beyond.
